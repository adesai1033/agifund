1. Data Ingestion and Initial Processing:

Identify Input Variables:

{{TICKER}}: Stock ticker symbol.

{{TECH_INDICATOR}}: Name of the technical indicator.

{{PERIOD_START}}: Start date of the analysis period.

{{PERIOD_END}}: End date of the analysis period.

{{INTERVAL}}: Time interval (e.g., daily, hourly).

{{STOCK_DATA}}: Time series data of the stock's price (Open, High, Low, Close).

{{INDICATOR_DATA}}: Time series data of the technical indicator's values.

Data Alignment:

Ensure both {{STOCK_DATA}} and {{INDICATOR_DATA}} are aligned by date and time, corresponding to the specified {{INTERVAL}}.

Handle any missing data points appropriately, noting them in the analysis if present. I will not impute or fill in any missing data.

2. <detailed_examination> Section:

a. Key Data Points and Patterns:

Indicator Extremes: Identify dates and values where the {{TECH_INDICATOR}} reached highs, lows, or other significant levels (potential overbought/oversold).

Price Extremes: Identify dates and values where the stock price ({{TICKER}}) reached significant highs or lows.

Crossovers/Thresholds: Note dates where the indicator crossed key thresholds or moving averages (if applicable based on the indicator).

Divergences: Observe instances where the indicator's trend (up/down) diverged from the stock price trend.

Notable Chart Patterns: Look for any recognizable chart patterns in the stock price data (e.g., head and shoulders, double tops/bottoms) that might correlate with the indicator's behavior.

Volume Spikes: In the {{STOCK_DATA}}, check for unusual volume activity that might coincide with indicator signals.

b. Correlation Analysis:

Visual Inspection: Plot the {{TECH_INDICATOR}} and stock price together to visually assess their relationship. I cannot generate charts but I will describe what a chart would show.

Temporal Relationship: Compare the timing of indicator signals (e.g., crossovers, divergences) with subsequent price movements.

Magnitude Correlation: Investigate if the magnitude of change in the indicator correlates with the magnitude of price change.

Unconventional Relationships: Search for any non-standard patterns or relationships between the indicator and price that might not be immediately obvious.

c. Lead/Lag, Overbought/Oversold, Triggers:

Lead/Lag Identification: Determine if the indicator consistently signals before or after price movements, noting specific examples.

Overbought/Oversold Zones: If the indicator has defined overbought/oversold zones, assess their effectiveness in predicting price reversals, using specific examples from the data.

Unique Triggers: Identify any specific indicator values or patterns that reliably precede significant price changes.

d. Counterarguments and Limitations:

False Signals: Identify instances where the indicator gave a signal, but the expected price movement did not occur.

Contradictory Data: Note any periods where the indicator and price movement directly contradicted each other.

Indicator-Specific Limitations: Based on the data, point out any inherent limitations of the {{TECH_INDICATOR}} in the context of the provided {{TICKER}} and timeframe.

e. Synergies with Other Signals:

Hypothetical Combinations: Suggest, without reference to external knowledge, how the {{TECH_INDICATOR}} might be combined with other common technical signals.

Example: "If the data showed a moving average, one could hypothesize that a trader might combine this with the {{TECH_INDICATOR}} to confirm trends." (Only if a moving average is actually present in the data.)

Data-Driven Suggestions: Base suggestions on how other signals present in the provided data interacted with the {{TECH_INDICATOR}} in the past.

f. Validation with Data References:

Specific Examples: For each conclusion, cite specific dates, indicator values, and price movements from the data to support the claim.

Quantitative Backing: Whenever possible, use quantitative measures (e.g., percentage change, number of periods) to strengthen the validation.
