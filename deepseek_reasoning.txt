1. Data Parsing and Preparation
Reasoning Trace:

Parse the provided <stock_data> and <indicator_data> to extract relevant columns (e.g., date, price, indicator values).

Ensure the data is aligned chronologically and matches the specified <interval> (e.g., daily, hourly).

Identify any missing or inconsistent data points and decide how to handle them (e.g., interpolation, exclusion).

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Reasoning Trace:

Calculate basic statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) for both stock prices and the technical indicator.

Plot the stock price and indicator values over time to visually identify trends, patterns, or anomalies.

Check for outliers or extreme values in the indicator data that might skew analysis.

3. Correlation Analysis
Reasoning Trace:

Compute statistical correlation (e.g., Pearson or Spearman) between the indicator and stock price movements.

Identify periods where the indicator and price movements align or diverge.

Explore lagged correlations to determine if the indicator leads or lags price changes.

4. Pattern and Threshold Identification
Reasoning Trace:

Identify common thresholds (e.g., overbought/oversold levels) for the indicator and assess their predictive power.

Look for recurring patterns (e.g., crossovers, divergences) that precede price movements.

Test whether these patterns hold consistently across the dataset or only in specific market conditions.

5. Lead/Lag Effects and Predictive Signals
Reasoning Trace:

Analyze whether the indicator provides early signals (lead) or confirms price movements (lag).

Test the indicator’s performance in different market phases (e.g., trending vs. ranging markets).

Evaluate if the indicator works better for short-term vs. long-term predictions.

6. Counterarguments and Limitations
Reasoning Trace:

Identify instances where the indicator fails to predict price movements or provides false signals.

Consider potential biases in the data (e.g., survivorship bias, small sample size).

Highlight any limitations in the dataset (e.g., insufficient time range, lack of volatility).

7. Synergies with Other Signals
Reasoning Trace:

Hypothesize how the indicator could complement other technical indicators (e.g., moving averages, RSI).

Suggest potential combinations that might improve predictive accuracy (e.g., using the indicator as a confirmation tool).

Test these hypotheses using the provided data, if possible.

8. Validation and Evidence-Based Conclusions
Reasoning Trace:

For each insight or conclusion, reference specific data points or patterns that support it.

Use statistical measures (e.g., accuracy, precision) to validate the indicator’s predictive power.

Ensure conclusions are grounded in the data and avoid overgeneralization.

9. Summary and Trader Applications
Reasoning Trace:

Synthesize the most actionable insights for traders (e.g., specific thresholds, patterns, or combinations).

Highlight the indicator’s strengths and weaknesses based on the analysis.

Provide clear, concise recommendations for incorporating the indicator into a trading strategy.

10. Disclaimer and Ethical Considerations
Reasoning Trace:

Emphasize that the analysis is based solely on the provided data and may not account for all market variables.

Clearly state that the analysis is not financial advice and should not be used as the sole basis for trading decisions.

Encourage traders to conduct further research and consult professionals before making investment decisions.
