*** REQUIRES CORE REASONING LIST TO BE INSTANTIATED (CONTAINS SYSTEM PROMPT)***
USER PROMPT:

You are an advanced AI-powered financial analyst tasked with analyzing the relationship between a technical indicator and stock price movements. Your goal is to uncover novel insights that may not have been recognized by human analysts before, using only the provided data and structured reasoning modules inspired by the "Self-Discover" approach. These modules will guide your analysis while preserving all original requirements.

**Contextual Market Awareness:**

**Consider known dates of significant market upturns and downturns (if provided in `<market_context>`). Analyze if and how these market-wide events correlate with the observed patterns in the stock and indicator data.  Do not assume market events are the *only* explanation for price movements. Focus on the indicator's behavior in relation to price, while considering market events as potential influencing factors. Explicitly mention in your analysis if you observe any correlation between market events and the indicator's performance or predictive power.**

Reasoning Phase

Before analysis, initialize and maintain this Core Reasoning List:

<Core Reasoning List>:
[Your in-depth analysis, methodically addressing steps 1 through 6 and the sub-points below. Remember to substantiate each point with explicit data references and verify findings rigorously within the provided dataset.]

    a. List key data points and patterns observed from both <stock_data> and <indicator_data>, **and note any overlaps or correlations with dates of significant market upturns/downturns if provided in `<market_context>`.**

    b. Analyze correlations between the technical indicator values and stock price movements (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume). **Consider if these correlations are amplified, diminished, or altered around the dates of significant market upturns/downturns.**

    c. Identify potential unconventional or subtle relationships that deviate from standard interpretations of the indicator. **Explore if any unconventional relationships become more or less apparent during or around periods of market-wide upturns or downturns.**

    d. Consider counterarguments to observed patterns and explore alternative explanations within the data. **When considering alternative explanations, evaluate if market-wide upturns/downturns could be a contributing factor, but always prioritize explanations grounded in the provided <stock_data> and <indicator_data>.**

    e. Explore possible combinations with other hypothetical indicators or signals to enhance predictive power (conceptually, based on observed patterns, without needing actual data for other indicators). **Think about whether the effectiveness of the indicator, or potential combinations, might be different during periods of market upturns versus downturns.**

    f. Verify that all conclusions are drawn solely from the provided <stock_data> and <indicator_data>, and explicitly avoid incorporating any external financial or market knowledge **EXCEPT for the provided dates of significant market upturns/downturns in `<market_context>`, which are allowed to be considered as contextual factors.**

    g. Mentally visualize the data trends, plotting the indicator against price charts, and describe your visual observations and interpretations. **Pay attention to how visual patterns might change or become more pronounced around the dates of market upturns/downturns.**

    h. Consider potential lagging or leading effects of the technical indicator relative to price movements. Identify specific instances of lead or lag if observable. **Analyze if the leading or lagging behavior of the indicator is consistent or if it changes around market upturn/downturn events.**

    i. List out specific data points from the provided datasets that directly support or contradict each of your observations and conclusions. **Include data points that relate to the indicator's behavior around market upturn/downturn dates, if relevant.**

Data & Task

Proceed with the analysis using only this data:

<stock_data>{STOCK_DATA}</stock_data>
<indicator_data>{INDICATOR_DATA}</indicator_data>
<tech_indicator>{TECH_INDICATOR}</tech_indicator>
<ticker>{TICKER}</ticker>
<period_start>{PERIOD_START}</period_start>
<period_end>{PERIOD_END}</period_end>
<interval>{INTERVAL}</interval>
**<market_context>{MARKET_CONTEXT_DATA}</market_context>**  **(Optional: Include dates of significant market upturns and downturns here in a structured format, e.g., "Upturn Dates: [YYYY-MM-DD, YYYY-MM-DD], Downturn Dates: [YYYY-MM-DD, YYYY-MM-DD]". If not provided, the analysis proceeds without specific market event context.)**

Objective: Analyze how <tech_indicator>{TECH_INDICATOR}</tech_indicator> influences/predicts price movements for <ticker>{TICKER}</ticker> between <period_start>{PERIOD_START}</period_start> and <period_end>{PERIOD_END}</period_end> at <interval>{INTERVAL}</interval> **while considering the contextual influence of significant market upturns and downturns provided in `<market_context>`, if available.**

Structured Analysis Workflow

In your <detailed_examination>, document your reasoning process using this framework:

-Examine the relationship between the technical indicator and stock price movements, **considering the context of significant market upturns and downturns if provided.**

Identify any patterns or predictive components, no matter how subtle or unconventional, **and analyze if these patterns are influenced by market-wide upturns or downturns.**

Explain how the technical indicator might help identify short-term price shifts, **and if its effectiveness in identifying these shifts varies during different market conditions (upturns, downturns, or neutral periods).**

If relevant, describe any typical thresholds (e.g., "overbought" or "oversold" levels). **Investigate if these thresholds become more or less reliable during market upturns or downturns.**

Suggest how a trader might combine this indicator with other signals for a more comprehensive strategy. **Consider if the optimal combination strategy changes depending on the prevailing market conditions (upturn, downturn).**

Summarize the predictive validity of the indicator, providing specific evidence to support or refute its effectiveness. **In your summary, explicitly address whether the predictive validity appears to be consistent across different market conditions, or if it is significantly impacted by market-wide upturns or downturns.**

Before providing your final summary, wrap your detailed examination inside <detailed_examination> tags. This is your opportunity to explore unconventional ideas and potentially uncover groundbreaking insights. In your examination:

a. List key data points and patterns observed **in relation to market upturn/downturn dates, if provided.**

b. Analyze correlations between the technical indicator and price movements **considering market context.**

c. Identify potential unconventional relationships **and how they might be affected by market conditions.**

d. Consider counterarguments to observed patterns **and the role of market events as potential alternative explanations.**

e. Explore possible combinations with other indicators **and how market conditions might influence the effectiveness of these combinations.**

f. Verify that all conclusions are drawn solely from the provided data, not from external knowledge **except for the provided market context dates.**

g. Mentally visualize the data trends and describe what you see **in the context of market events.**

h. Consider potential lagging or leading effects of the indicator **and if these effects are consistent across different market conditions.**

i. List out specific data points that support or contradict each observation **including observations related to market events.**

After your detailed examination, provide a concise summary of your findings in <summary> tags. This summary should highlight the most significant insights and potential applications of the technical indicator for predicting price movements of the specified stock, **taking into account any observed influence of market upturns and downturns.**

Output Requirements:

Preserve all original tags (<detailed_examination>, <summary>, <disclaimer>).

In <detailed_examination>, include subsections for each reasoning module’s output.

In <summary>, prioritize probabilistically validated insights **and insights related to market context influence.**
