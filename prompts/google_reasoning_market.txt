Your response must be structured in three distinct sections, each enclosed within specific tags:

<detailed_examination> - This section will contain your in-depth and methodical analysis. Within this section, you are required to follow a series of predefined steps (a through i, as detailed in the Context Dump). This is where you will explore the data, identify patterns, analyze relationships, and present your arguments and counterarguments, all supported by data references.

<summary> - Following the detailed examination, provide a concise summary of your most significant findings and insights. This section should highlight the key takeaways from your analysis regarding the technical indicator's behavior and potential predictive validity, *particularly in the context of major market events*.

<disclaimer> - Conclude your response with a clear disclaimer stating that your analysis is for informational purposes only and should not be considered financial advice or the sole basis for making investment decisions.

<Warnings>WARNINGS<Warnings>
Data Limitation: You are strictly limited to using only the data provided within <stock_data>, <indicator_data>, *and <market_event_dates>*. Do not incorporate any external knowledge, pre-existing financial theories, or data from outside sources. All conclusions and observations must be derived solely from the datasets given to you.

No Financial Advice: Your analysis is for informational and analytical purposes only. It must not be construed as financial advice, investment recommendations, or guidance for trading decisions. You must explicitly state this in the disclaimer section.

Objective and Data-Driven: Maintain a purely objective and data-driven approach. Avoid speculation that is not directly supported by the provided data. Focus on identifying patterns, correlations, and potential predictive signals strictly within the confines of the given datasets, *including considering how market events might influence these aspects*.

Comprehensive Analysis: While seeking novel insights, ensure your analysis is comprehensive and addresses both conventional and unconventional interpretations. Explore potential counterarguments and validate your findings rigorously against the data, *while also considering if market-wide events strengthen or weaken observed patterns*.

<contextdump>CONTEXT DUMP<contextdump>
Data Provided:

<stock_data>{STOCK_DATA}</stock_data>: This contains candle data for the specified stock, including Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume for each time interval.
<indicator_data>{INDICATOR_DATA}</indicator_data>: This includes the calculated values of the specified technical indicator for each corresponding time interval in the stock data.
<tech_indicator>{TECH_INDICATOR}</tech_indicator>: Specifies the name of the technical indicator being analyzed.
<ticker>{TICKER}</ticker>: Indicates the stock ticker symbol.
<period_start>{PERIOD_START}</period_start>: Defines the starting date for the analysis period.
<period_end>{PERIOD_END}</period_end>: Defines the ending date for the analysis period.
<interval>{INTERVAL}</interval>: Specifies the time interval of the data (e.g., daily, hourly).
<market_event_dates>{MARKET_EVENT_DATES}</market_event_dates>: This contains a list of dates that correspond to significant market-wide upturns or downturns within the analysis period.  *This data should be used to contextualize your analysis and understand if major market movements influence the indicator's behavior or predictive capabilities.*

Analysis Steps within <detailed_examination>:

Examine Relationship: Analyze the relationship between the <tech_indicator> values and the stock price movements as represented in <stock_data>. Consider various aspects of price movement (e.g., price direction, volatility, magnitude of changes), *and how these relationships might be affected during or around the market event dates provided in <market_event_dates>*.

Identify Patterns: Search for any recurring patterns or signals where the technical indicator might precede, coincide with, or follow specific stock price movements. Explore both traditional patterns and any subtle, unconventional patterns. Look for potential predictive components. *Investigate if these patterns are consistent across different market conditions, including periods around major market events*.

Short-Term Price Shifts: Investigate how the <tech_indicator> might be used to identify potential short-term price shifts. Analyze if specific indicator values or changes correlate with subsequent short-term price increases or decreases, *and if these correlations are different during major market upturns or downturns*.

Typical Thresholds: If applicable and evident from the data, identify and describe any typical threshold levels for the <tech_indicator> (e.g., levels that might be traditionally considered "overbought" or "oversold"). Assess their relevance based on the provided data, *and consider if these thresholds become more or less reliable during market event periods*.

Indicator Combinations: Suggest potential ways a trader might combine this <tech_indicator> with other hypothetical signals or conditions (derived solely from the data itself, not external indicators) to create a more robust trading strategy. Explore how combining observable patterns could improve signal reliability. *Consider if the effectiveness of these combinations is impacted by major market events*.

Predictive Validity: Summarize the predictive validity of the <tech_indicator> based on your analysis of the data. Provide specific data points and observations to either support or refute its effectiveness as a predictor of price movements for the given stock. *Specifically discuss if market events seem to enhance, diminish, or alter the indicator's predictive capabilities*.

Detailed Examination Sub-points (within <detailed_examination>):

a. Key Data Points, Patterns, and Market Events: List specific data points that stand out and describe any initial patterns you observe between the <tech_indicator> and price movements. Be precise and reference specific data instances. *Explicitly note any patterns that seem to coincide with or be influenced by the market event dates provided.*

b. Correlations Analysis: Analyze and describe any correlations you identify between the <tech_indicator> values and stock price movements. Quantify correlations qualitatively (e.g., "strong positive correlation when indicator is above X"). *Investigate if these correlations are stable or change significantly during or around major market event dates.*

c. Unconventional Relationships: Explore and identify any unconventional or less obvious relationships that might exist. Think beyond standard interpretations of the indicator and consider non-linear relationships or unusual signal patterns. *Consider if market events reveal or obscure any unconventional relationships.*

d. Counterarguments: For each observed pattern or potential predictive signal, consider and present potential counterarguments or data points that contradict your initial observations. This ensures a balanced and critical analysis. *Include counterarguments that arise when considering market event periods.*

e. Indicator Combinations (Data-Driven) and Market Event Context: Explore hypothetical combinations of observations or patterns within the data itself (not external indicators). How could combining different data-driven signals improve the analysis? *Assess if the effectiveness of these combinations is consistent across periods with and without major market events.*

f. Data-Only Verification: Explicitly verify that all your conclusions are drawn solely from the provided <stock_data>, <indicator_data>, *and <market_event_dates>*. State that no external knowledge is used for each conclusion.

g. Data Visualization (Mental) in Relation to Market Events: Mentally visualize the trends of both the <tech_indicator> and stock prices. Describe what you "see" in these visualizations â€“ e.g., "When the indicator rises sharply, price tends to follow with a slight delay," or "High indicator values coincide with increased price volatility." *Specifically consider if these visualizations change or reveal new insights when viewed in the context of the provided market event dates.*

h. Lagging/Leading Effects and Market Event Influence: Analyze and describe any potential lagging or leading effects of the <tech_indicator> in relation to price movements. Does the indicator typically precede price changes, or does it react to price changes? Quantify the observed lag or lead if possible. *Investigate if these lagging or leading effects are altered or more pronounced around major market event dates.*

i. Supporting/Contradicting Data Points and Market Event Context: For each major observation or conclusion, explicitly list specific data points from the provided datasets that either strongly support or contradict your point. This grounds your analysis in concrete evidence. *When listing supporting or contradicting data points, also consider data points specifically from periods around the market event dates and note if they strengthen or weaken your conclusions.*
