USER PROMPT:
<Goal>GOAL<Goal>
Your goal is to conduct a novel and thorough analysis of the relationship between a specified technical indicator and the price movements of a given stock, strictly using only the data provided. You are tasked with uncovering insightful and potentially unconventional patterns or predictive capabilities that might not be immediately obvious through traditional financial analysis methods. Your analysis should be data-driven, rigorous, and aimed at exploring both conventional and groundbreaking interpretations of the indicator's behavior in relation to stock prices. The ultimate objective is to assess the indicator's potential for predicting stock price shifts based solely on the provided data, pushing beyond standard analytical approaches to discover hidden insights, **while being mindful of potential market-wide impacts, particularly around dates of significant market upturns and downturns ([MARKET_UPTURN_DATES_PLACEHOLDER] and [MARKET_DOWNTURN_DATES_PLACEHOLDER]).**

Your response must be structured in three distinct sections, each enclosed within specific tags:

<detailed_examination> - This section will contain your in-depth and methodical analysis. Within this section, you are required to follow a series of predefined steps (a through i, as detailed in the Context Dump). This is where you will explore the data, identify patterns, analyze relationships, and present your arguments and counterarguments, all supported by data references. **In your analysis, consider the potential influence of major market upturns and downturns, especially around the dates [MARKET_UPTURN_DATES_PLACEHOLDER] and [MARKET_DOWNTURN_DATES_PLACEHOLDER], on the observed relationships. However, remember that the primary driver of analysis remains the provided <stock_data> and <indicator_data>, and market events are to be considered as contextual factors, not primary determinants.**

<summary> - Following the detailed examination, provide a concise summary of your most significant findings and insights. This section should highlight the key takeaways from your analysis regarding the technical indicator's behavior and potential predictive validity.

<disclaimer> - Conclude your response with a clear disclaimer stating that your analysis is for informational purposes only and should not be considered financial advice or the sole basis for making investment decisions.

Analysis Steps within <detailed_examination>:

Examine Relationship: Analyze the relationship between the <tech_indicator> values and the stock price movements as represented in <stock_data>. Consider various aspects of price movement (e.g., price direction, volatility, magnitude of changes).

Identify Patterns: Search for any recurring patterns or signals where the technical indicator might precede, coincide with, or follow specific stock price movements. Explore both traditional patterns and any subtle, unconventional patterns. Look for potential predictive components.

Short-Term Price Shifts: Investigate how the <tech_indicator> might be used to identify potential short-term price shifts. Analyze if specific indicator values or changes correlate with subsequent short-term price increases or decreases.

Typical Thresholds: If applicable and evident from the data, identify and describe any typical threshold levels for the <tech_indicator> (e.g., levels that might be traditionally considered "overbought" or "oversold"). Assess their relevance based on the provided data.

Indicator Combinations: Suggest potential ways a trader might combine this <tech_indicator> with other hypothetical signals or conditions (derived solely from the data itself, not external indicators) to create a more robust trading strategy. Explore how combining observable patterns could improve signal reliability.

Predictive Validity: Summarize the predictive validity of the <tech_indicator> based on your analysis of the data. Provide specific data points and observations to either support or refute its effectiveness as a predictor of price movements for the given stock.

Detailed Examination Sub-points (within <detailed_examination>):

a. Key Data Points and Patterns: List specific data points that stand out and describe any initial patterns you observe between the <tech_indicator> and price movements. Be precise and reference specific data instances. **a.i. Market Event Context: Examine if any identified key data points or patterns coincide with or are potentially influenced by known dates of significant market upturns ([MARKET_UPTURN_DATES_PLACEHOLDER]) or downturns ([MARKET_DOWNTURN_DATES_PLACEHOLDER]). Note any observable differences in indicator or price behavior around these dates compared to periods without such market events.**

b. Correlations Analysis: Analyze and describe any correlations you identify between the <tech_indicator> values and stock price movements. Quantify correlations qualitatively (e.g., "strong positive correlation when indicator is above X").

c. Unconventional Relationships: Explore and identify any unconventional or less obvious relationships that might exist. Think beyond standard interpretations of the indicator and consider non-linear relationships or unusual signal patterns. **c.i. Market Event Anomalies: Specifically investigate if any unconventional relationships or atypical indicator behaviors are observed around the dates of significant market upturns ([MARKET_UPTURN_DATES_PLACEHOLDER]) or downturns ([MARKET_DOWNTURN_DATES_PLACEHOLDER]).**

d. Counterarguments: For each observed pattern or potential predictive signal, consider and present potential counterarguments or data points that contradict your initial observations. This ensures a balanced and critical analysis.

e. Indicator Combinations (Data-Driven): Explore hypothetical combinations of observations or patterns within the data itself (not external indicators). How could combining different data-driven signals improve the analysis?

f. Data-Only Verification: Explicitly verify that all your conclusions are drawn solely from the provided <stock_data> and <indicator_data>. State that no external knowledge is used for each conclusion.

g. Data Visualization (Mental): Mentally visualize the trends of both the <tech_indicator> and stock prices. Describe what you "see" in these visualizations â€“ e.g., "When the indicator rises sharply, price tends to follow with a slight delay," or "High indicator values coincide with increased price volatility."

h. Lagging/Leading Effects: Analyze and describe any potential lagging or leading effects of the <tech_indicator> in relation to price movements. Does the indicator typically precede price changes, or does it react to price changes? Quantify the observed lag or lead if possible.

i. Supporting/Contradicting Data Points: For each major observation or conclusion, explicitly list specific data points from the provided datasets that either strongly support or contradict your point. This grounds your analysis in concrete evidence.
